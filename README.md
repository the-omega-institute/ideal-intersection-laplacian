# Laplacian integrality of ideal intersection graphs

Public workspace for the follow-on collaboration between **Haobo Ma,
Reza Nikandish and Wenlin Zhang**, studying ideal intersection graphs of
`Z_n` and their Laplacian spectra.

Our first question is the **Laplacian integrality characterization**:
which graphs in this family have only integer Laplacian eigenvalues?
This is a new research track; no complete characterization is claimed here.

## First results

We prove nonintegrality for every squarefree integer with at least three
distinct prime factors and for every exponent vector that is a permutation
of `(1,1,k)`, `k >= 1`. This completes the squarefree composite classification:
the integral case is exactly two prime factors, including the edgeless graph.
Read [the proofs and exact verification scope](notes/integrality-obstructions.md).
Reza's [further infinite family](notes/repeated-exponent-family.md) covers
`(a,a,(a-1)(2a-1))`, `a >= 2`, including `(2,2,3)`. Its antisymmetric block
has integer eigenvalues; a symmetric cubic proves nonintegrality.
The full characterization for arbitrary exponent vectors remains open.

## Current status

We have agreed to start with Q3, the integrality question proposed by Reza.
The graph convention has been reviewed. The working manuscript consolidates
the squarefree classification, the `(1,1,k)` family, Reza's boundary family,
the unified linear cutoff, and the three complete fixed-exponent families.
Reza's diagnostic request now has exact output for all 90 requested pairs.
A factor-pair argument proves nonintegrality for every `(a,a,b)` with
`a=2,3,4` and `b>=1`; the full characterization remains open.
For every `a>=1`, all `b>(a-1)(2a-1)` are also covered by the general
discriminant bound; Reza's earlier theorem covers equality for `a>=2`.
A congruence sharpens the remaining range to `b <= floor(R(a))`, with
`R(a)=2(a-1)(a-2)/(a+2)` for every `a>=2`. Every larger `b` is nonintegral;
read the linear cutoff proof in the note above.

The original preprint is awaiting public announcement. This repository begins
with the agreed research plan and our follow-on contributions. Its confidential
PDF, correspondence and unannounced manuscript content are kept outside the
public repository. A public source link can be added when available.

## How we work

We use short cycles of conjecture, proof or counterexample, and independent
verification. Each contribution states its assumptions and separates written
proofs, exact finite computations and Lean verification.

The initial work is to fix the graph convention and spectral reduction,
then develop the integrality argument. Vertex connectivity may become a
companion result if it fits naturally; other invariants and unequal-exponent
matrix questions remain later directions.

Use one focused pull request for each checked contribution, with a readable
explanation and reproducible evidence where relevant. Existing collaborator
edits are preserved. See [rights and provenance](RIGHTS.md).
