# Laplacian integrality of ideal intersection graphs

Public workspace for the follow-on collaboration between **Haobo Ma,
Reza Nikandish and Wenlin Zhang**, studying ideal intersection graphs of
`Z_n` and their Laplacian spectra.

Our first question is the **Laplacian integrality characterization**:
which graphs in this family have only integer Laplacian eigenvalues?
This is a new research track; no complete characterization is claimed here.

## Current status

We have agreed to start with Q3, the integrality question proposed by Reza.
Wenlin confirms receipt of the privately shared preprint. The working
definitions and previously established cases still need to be reviewed against
that manuscript before being used in new proofs.

The original preprint is awaiting public announcement. This repository begins
with public project navigation and the agreed research plan. Its confidential
PDF, correspondence and unannounced manuscript content are kept outside the
public repository. A public source link can be added when available.

## How we work

We use short cycles of conjecture, proof or counterexample, and independent
verification. Each contribution states its assumptions and separates written
proofs, exact finite computations and Lean verification.

The initial work is to fix the graph convention and spectral reduction,
then develop the integrality argument. Vertex connectivity may become a
companion result if it fits naturally; other invariants and unequal-exponent
matrix questions remain later directions.

Use one focused pull request for each checked contribution, with a readable
explanation and reproducible evidence where relevant. Existing collaborator
edits are preserved. See [rights and provenance](RIGHTS.md).
